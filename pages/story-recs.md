## Story recommendations
These are sorta sorted by how much I liked them, but I wanted to split all the Kammiverse and Troubleverse stories to their own categories since there's several each and they're set in shared universes. I really liked every story on this page, so even if its lower down I still thoroughly recommend it. ^-^

Should probably note that most of these will have trans lesbian protagonists as I like reading stories that feel relatable I guess... I'd say they're still well written enough to probably be enjoyable for everyone though so my recommendation still applies to everyone, just more so if your a gay trans girl. ;P

I'll be abbreviating the site names when linking these stories, the sites are:
- [(SH)](https://scribblehub.com "Scribble Hub"): Scribble Hub, this is my personal favorite site for reading on. Most of the stories I link will be on here.
- [(TGST)](https://tgstorytime.com "TG Storytime"): TG Storytime, some of the older Kammiverse stories aren't on Scribble Hub in which case I usually read them here, otherwise I don't use it much.
- [(RR)](https://royalroad.com "Royal Road"): Royal Road, I don't really read on here, but most of the Kammiverse stories were originally only published on here and TG Storytime.


I'll try do mini reviews of each of the stories, but I haven't reviewed books before and its been a bit since I read some of these so maybe just click through and read the synopsis and reviews on the site for a better idea of the story. ;P Sorry for any stories that I haven't made a review thingy for yet, I haven't read those recently enough to really give a good review right now... I'll try come back and finish those soon™️.

### Kammiverse
QuietValerie's Kammiverse setting is a shared universe between many great trans stories from several authors where in an event called the "Emergence" people get super powers and futuristic tech magically shows up around the world. It's a pretty cool setting with a lot of great stories in it. Below I'll list the ones I've read so far, there are more that I haven't read yet and I'm sure are probably good too, but it'd be kinda weird to recommend a story I haven't read. ;P The chronology of the stories can be found [here on TG Storytime](https://tgstorytime.com/viewstory.php?sid=5077 "Kammi-verse story chronology").
- ***Kammi Kettu* [(SH)][kk-sh] [(TGST)][kk-tgst] [(RR)][kk-rr] by QuietValerie**<br>
  *Kammi Kettu* is the base story of the whole Kammiverse, so while most work fine on their own I'd recommend reading Kammi Kettu first (or alongside Songbird as they connect very closely, both stories let you know when they have strongly connected chapters). Its got a cool setting, fun action scenes, some pretty dark parts, and a lots of gay!
- ***Songbird* [(SH)][s-sh] [(TGST)][s-tgst] [(RR)][s-rr] by Trashlyn**<br>
  This story is the closest connected to Kammi Kettu with several chapters showing the same events from different perspectives. It starts off quite dark, but even in the darkest parts its still a great read. *Songbird* does a great job expanding on the world of the Kammiverse.
- ***Falling Over* [(SH)][fo-sh] [(TGST)][fo-tgst] by QuietValerie**<br>
  *Falling Over* is probably QuietValerie's most slice of life story, with less action than most of her other stories, but that simply means more time for queer romance, drama, and conflict, which this story excels at.
- ***The Will of Bastet* [(TGST)][twob-tgst] [(RR)][twob-rr] by Kara Null**<br>
- ***A Mouse in the Circuitry* [(SH)][amitc-sh] [(TGST)][amitc-tgst] [(RR)][amitc-rr] by Katie-the-Angel-Witch**<br>
- ***A Wolf In Penrith* [(TGST)][awip-tgst] [(RR)][awip-rr] by DerbyGhost**<br>
- ***Pellan Rise* [(SH)][pr-sh] [(TGST)][pr-tgst] [(RR)][pr-rr] by QuietValerie** <small>// (NOTE: Royal Road does not have the epilogue as QuietValerie no longer posts there)</small><br>
  *Pellan Rise* has the characters playing the VRMMO game Pellan Rise, but as it turns out the world of Pellan Rise is be more connected to the real world that anyone expected. The story has connections to the Kammiverse later on, which is why I'm categorizing it in the Kammiverse. Unfortunately, the story has been put on permanent hiatus due to QuiteValerie losing interest in writing it, and while she did write an epilogue, it does end before really being *done*.

### Troubleverse
- ***Trouble With Horns* [(SH)][twh-sh] [(TGST)][twh-tgst] by QuietValerie**<br>

- ***Snowbound* [(SH)][sb-sh] by Chirichirichiri**<br>
- ***Witch of Chains* [(SH)][woc-sh] by QuiteValerie**<br>

### Other
- ***Ryn of Avonside* [(SH)][roa-sh] [(TGST)][roa-tgst] by QuietValerie**<br>
- ***Twisted Destiny* [(SH)][td-sh] by FieryKathy**<br>
- ***The Yin Physique* [(SH)][typ-sh] by Chirichirichiri**<br>
- ***The Other World is Leaking!* [(SH)][towil-sh] by LuminaMystere**
- ***Deviled Egg* [(SH)][de-sh] by Katie-the-Angel-Witch**<br>
- ***Jötnar: Mother Of Monsters* [(SH)][jmom-sh] by Breefolk**<br>
