## About
Hi! I'm <ruby>Evie<rp> (</rp><rt>/ˈɛv.i/</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby>, aka Pk11 or Epicpkmn11 on some older accounts. I'm a trans girl who likes likes programming, particularly DS(i) homebrew, and am trying to learn Japanese, haven't taken like proper classes on it or anything but decided one day to set all my computers to Japanese and just hoped I could figure it out lol. For programming I mostly code in C++ since that's a language you can use for DS(i) homebrew, but I also know some Python, JavaScript, and a bit of Java.

I don't like talking about myself much so that's all for this, here's about every public account I have for things that I can remember because I felt like finding them to see how many I had:

If you're curious, I started switching to Pk11 somewhere around early to mid 2019 since I didn't like being called 'epic' for short, I've retroactively changed as many things as I could to Pk11, but its often unavailable since its short and thus commonly taken and sometimes even too short to use outright, in which case I'll usually still fall back to Epicpkmn11 or sometimes add an underscore.

The name origin is that a friend's friend's Minecraft account that I used to use was 'epic1236' and when signing up for Pokémon Trainer Club to like play Pokémon flash games or so that came to mind so epic + pkmn, but that was taken so Epicpkmn1? nope, Epicpkmn11? yep, and thus became my online name lol. 11 has since become a number I like because of that so I've kept it for the most part. And I shortened to Pk11 since pk was always the part I liked shortening to the most.

## Devices
Since I'm in the mood for things about me in list form, I figured why not go over the devices I use a lot ;P

Computers:
- [MacBook Air (Mid 2013)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130730215607/http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) <small>// Probably favorite laptop of all time so far and still feels like new in 2021, though I do prefer the iBook G4's keyboard</small>
- [Mac Pro (Early 2008)](https://web.archive.org/web/20080327043036/http://www.apple.com/macpro/) <small>// 13 years old, wow, still runs great unless I try to run a game more intense than Minecraft or so</small>
- [iBook G4 (Mid 2005)](https://web.archive.org/web/20051230010437/http://www.apple.com/ibook/) <small>// Haven't used this as much recently, but one of my all time top laptops and still works quite well for its age</small>

Phone:
- [京セラ GRATINA 4G](https://www.kyocera.co.jp/prdct/telecom/consumer/lineup/kyf31-kyf34/) (Kyocera GRATINA 4G) <small>// Flip phones are neat and this one has Android ;P</small>

Other:

- [Nintendo DSi (1.4.5J)](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/dsi/) <small>// Can we just take a moment to appreciate that this website is still up</small>
- [Nintendo DSi LL (1.4J)](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiLL/) <small title="This too!">// これも！</small>
- [PS Vita (2000, 3.65 変革-2)](https://www.jp.playstation.com/psvita/) <small>// <span title="Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA">初音ミク -Project DIVA-</span> is fun</small>
- [Kobo Clara HD](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-hd) <small>// 6" screen, warm light mode, technically [upgradable storage](https://yingtongli.me/blog/2018/07/29/kobo-sd.html) (I have 128GB!), overall a nice eReader imo</small>
- [iPod nano (6th Generation)](https://web.archive.org/web/20101201062834/http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/) <small>// *Still the best [Apple Watch](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4665789)*</small>
  - [Sony MDR-E9LP In-Ear Headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/in-ear-headphones/mdr-e9lp) <small>// I am by definition fashionable when wearing these, it said so on the box lol</small>

## Profile pics
I've kept every revision I've made to my profile pics over the years and Dropbox even has the last edit dates, though the times for any of these before near 2020 may actually not be quite when I started using them (especially the first one, I feel like that's gotta be more like 2012) but definitely feel about right for when I was using them for most.

- 2014-05-04 - Epicpkmn11 1.png <small>// I made this for my YouTube way back when I was trying to make Minecraft videos</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (1)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-1.png)

- 2016-12-19 - Epicpkmn11 2.png <small>// Similar base concept, but I added some *cool lines* and Poké Balls since I was getting back into Pokémon, also changed the font and made the text kinda angled *cause angles are cool* lol</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (2)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-2.png)

- 2018-07-20 - Epicpkmn11 3.png <small>// *Brace yourself, radical change time*... Wait no, just blurred it a bit. I feel like this date is way off since iirc I made this very shortly after and this is what I was using for years, maybe I'm wrong though</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (3)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-3.png)

- 2019-01-08 - Epicpkmn11 CD 1.png <small>// Wow, this I can both confirm is right ± maybe 5 days but I thought it was longer ago...</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (Chief Delphi 1)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-cd-1.png)

- 2019-01-08 - Epicpkmn11 CD 2.png <small>// Not even sure why I kept the last one, I didn't even use it for a day, but these were both made specifically for Chief Delphi to incorporate our robotics team's logo</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (Chief Delphi 2)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-cd-2.png)

- 2019-01-16 - Pk11 1.png <small>// Wait January? I thought it was later in 2019, guess it was January or I can time travel though, this is still one I sometimes use, though not as much recently (Yes, it is named 1 and no there isn't a second)</small>

  ![Pk11 (1)](/assets/images/pfp/pk11-1.png)

- 2019-11-15 - Evie 1.png <small>// I started feeling that my old ones were a bit too impersonal, so I drew myself as a cat girl! ;P I wouldn't say I *dislike* this drawing necessarily, but I do *much* prefer the style of my next one.</small>
  <br><small>// (These were drawn in Colors! for the Nintendo DS, as opposed to to my old ones all being from Paint.NET, I also finally know the exact dates since I uploaded them to Colors! Live. You can click these for full size since they were exported at max size)</small>

  [![Evie (1)](/assets/images/pfp/evie-1.png){:.img-small}](/assets/images/pfp/evie-1.png)

- 2020-02-13 - Evie 2.png <small>// As of writing this I'd say that I legitimately like this picture, my last one just kinda felt a bit *off*. Not *bad*, just not quite right, it was my first real attempt to draw well... anything in like at least 5 years though. This one I think does a pretty good job capturing the feel I was going for. Maybe I'll come back in another 3 months with something better, but for now I quite like it ^_^</small>
