# About
Hi! I'm <ruby>Evie<rp> (</rp><rt>/ˈɛv.i/</rt><rp>) </rp></ruby>, aka Pk11 or Epicpkmn11 on some older accounts. I'm a trans girl who likes likes programming, particularly DS(i) homebrew, and am trying to learn Japanese, haven't taken like proper classes on it or anything but decided one day to set all my computers to Japanese and just hoped I could figure it out lol. For programming I mostly code in C++ since that's a language you can use for DS(i) homebrew, but I also know some Python, JavaScript, and a bit of Java.

I don't like talking about myself much so that's all for this, here's some of my main online profiles:

## Profile pics
I've kept every revision I've made to my profile pics over the years and Dropbox even has the last edit dates, though the times for any of these before near 2020 may actually not be quite when I started using them (especially the first one, I feel like that's gotta be more like 2012) but definitely feel about right for when I was using them for most.

- 2014-05-04 - Epicpkmn11 1.png <small>// I made this for my YouTube way back when I was trying to make Minecraft videos</small>

- 2016-12-19 - Epicpkmn11 2.png <small>// Similar base concept, but I added some *cool lines* and Poké Balls since I was getting back into Pokémon, also changed the font and made the text kinda angled *cause angles are cool* lol</small>

- 2018-07-20 - Epicpkmn11 3.png <small>// *Brace yourself, radical change time*... Wait no, just blurred it a bit. I feel like this date is way off since iirc I made this very shortly after and this is what I was using for years, maybe I'm wrong though</small>

  ![Epicpkmn11 (3)](/assets/images/pfp/epicpkmn11-3.png)

- 2019-01-16 - Pk11 1.png <small>// Wait January? I thought it was later in 2019, guess it was January or I can time travel though, this is still one I sometimes use, though not as much recently (Yes, it is named 1 and no there isn't a second)</small>

- 2019-11-15 - Evie 1.png <small>// I started feeling that my old ones were a bit too impersonal, so I drew myself as a cat girl! ;P I wouldn't say I *dislike* this drawing necessarily, but I do *much* prefer the style of my next one.</small>
  <br><small>// (These were drawn in Colors! for the Nintendo DS, as opposed to to my old ones all being from Paint.NET, I also finally know the exact dates since I uploaded them to Colors! Live. You can click these for full size since they were exported at max size)</small>

- 2020-02-13 - Evie 2.png <small>// As of writing this I'd say that I legitimately like this picture, my last one just kinda felt a bit *off*. Not *bad*, just not quite right, it was my first real attempt to draw well... anything in like at least 5 years though. This one I think does a pretty good job capturing the feel I was going for. Maybe I'll come back in another 3 months with something better, but for now I quite like it ^_^</small>
