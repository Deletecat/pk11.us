				<p class="paragraph">You have found yourself in an experiment in the making, the great resource center for team 2855 BEASTBot, by the Bumper Boys with a Z. Here you can find past and present game manuals, computer software, bumper building guides, and much more. You can also find our new experimental scouting page, a system which we hope to develop into a real time scouting system we can use at tournaments that everyone can access. This page will be receiving updates in the coming months, and I hope that all BEASTBot members will be able to benefit from this project! Keep in mind that this is a work in progress, so some things will look incomplete.<br/>-The Bumper Boys with a Z.</p>
